# automation
Small projects attempting to automate mundane tasks using python. Some of these are based on the book "Automate the Boring Stuff Using Python" by Al Sweigart.

I will try my best to make the codes as readable so one may try to replicate these projects on their own machines. Detailed descriptions of each file will be given in the files themselves.

### PDF Combiner

combinePdfs.py will take all the pdfs in the current working directory and combine them into one file

### Automatic Twitter 'bot'

song_tweet.py uses the Twitter API to tweet song recommendations automatically. Songs are choosen randomly from a collection of over 100 songs in the excel file Song_list.xlsx. Using pythonanywhere (www.pythonanywhere.com), this script runs once a day at 6:30 UTC

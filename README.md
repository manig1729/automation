# automation
Small projects attempting to automate mundane tasks using python. Some of these are based on the book "Automate the Boring Stuff Using Python" by Al Sweigart

I will try my best to make the codes as readable so one may try to replicate these projects on their own machines. Descriptions of each file will be given in the files themselves.
